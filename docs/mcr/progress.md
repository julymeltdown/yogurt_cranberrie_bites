# Execution record

Updated 2026-11-03. This record supersedes intake-only status statements in the
historical assessments. `generated/` remains the original planning baseline.
Acceptance below applies only to the stated task criteria and candidate paths;
it is not feature integration or release acceptance.

| Task | State | Evidence and remaining scope |
|---|---|---|
| C01 | ACCEPTED | [Source map](source-map.md), two reviewed per-file inventories and exact import whitelist. Headless candidates need their own later extraction approval/tests. |
| C02 | ACCEPTED | [Foundation qualification](evidence/foundation.md): pinned frozen installation, strict FE build/lint, pinned source and imported full BE workspace builds. Docker execution is NOT_RUN and is not claimed by this minimal build task. |
| C03 | ACCEPTED | [Frozen core v0.1 contract](core-contract.md), exact inherited auth mapping, public/private DTOs, 33 examples and 23 tests; three scoped reviews. Email/core consumers can proceed. Optional OAuth exposure remains explicitly disabled until a separate handoff revision; runtime implementation is NOT_RUN. |
| C04 | IN_PROGRESS | [Domain review candidate](domain-contract.md), [target/query follow-up](evidence/domain-targets.md), [combined assembly](evidence/domain-assembly.md) and [internal keyed fingerprint correction](evidence/receipt-fingerprint-review.md) `9044417`: 162 definitions, 106 operations, 25 closed query schemas, 75 semantic rules, 15 inherited mappings, 36 payload fixtures, 47 domain and 15 assembly tests. Final/core pipeline emits 132 HTTP operations without changing frozen C03. Full context coverage, deletion/legal/retention, client qualification and independent reviews remain; not frozen or runtime-qualified. |
| C05 | ACCEPTED | [Frozen realtime v1.0.0](realtime-contract.md): strict frame/HTTP schemas and admission/stream rules, 24 fixtures and 31 regressions. [BE/FE rechecks](qa/realtime-contract-review.md) find no remaining scoped issues after corrections. Runtime ticket, socket, queue, capacity and race tests are NOT_RUN. |
| C06 | CONTRACT_READY | Five asset schemas and six golden fixtures preserve shared geometry/avatar identity. [Format correction](evidence/asset-format-validation.md) and [independent review](qa/asset-format-review.md) close missing checker and final-LF gaps; 27 C06 and 144 combined regressions pass. No schema/fixture bytes changed. Pixel alignment/art/venue truth remain NOT_RUN. |
| AR03 | IN_PROGRESS | [User-selected character source pack](character-art.md), revision 3: twenty unique JPEGs (ten base sheets plus ten additions); the first batch's duplicate stays archived. Source catalog and frontend lookup preserve both selected batches. Previous character art is prohibited. Transparent cutouts, layer-contract revision and direction/walk atlas remain. |
| C08 | ACCEPTED | [Origin gate](qa/ui-origin.md), empty exact allowlist, 14 negative/positive test cases and current source scan pass. Modified copies and visual similarity require manual review; QA02 is not accepted. |
| BE01 | ACCEPTED | [Integrated foundation review](evidence/core-foundation-integration.md): 1,071 pinned files imported, full workspace builds, six separate services and exact owned process/port/database map exercised without source-default DB targets. |
| BE02 | ACCEPTED | [Integrated tooling review](evidence/privacy-local-stack-integration.md): native migration/restart persistence, owned foreground stack and private mail, 55 helper and 16 development tests, reviewed image/protobuf/SQL paths. Docker execution and production roles remain NOT_RUN and must be qualified before packaging/BE44. |
| BE03 | INTEGRATED | [Email ingress review](evidence/browser-auth-integration.md), candidate `689e4d2`: parent reran 221 Gateway tests, nine harness tests and 53 real native HTTP checks with three mail deliveries and cleanup PASS. Frozen email/account mapping, browser guards and invalid-credential handling delivered. Real browser cookie policy, configured OAuth and complete BE03 acceptance remain open. |
| BE04 | IN_PROGRESS | [HTTP identity composition](evidence/http-identity-integration.md) integrates strict HTTP extraction, sequential configured Auth/Profile reads and retained shorter-deadline checks. Parent actual HTTP6/composition8/library-binary/test-link checks pass. The real two-owner HTTP/PostgreSQL journey is active; signed Concert admission, event authority and whole identity acceptance remain open. |
| BE05 | ACCEPTED | [Integrated foundation review](evidence/concert-core-integration.md), source/workspace/doc `6a08701`/`f5b188b`/`376cf21`: typed hexagonal values/clock/policy ports, constrained event/participant/avatar schema, 12 Rust + 12 Python tests and three real PostgreSQL tests. Parent reran owned migration/reapply/schema-damage refusal, health/outage/restart/graceful cleanup. No product API or invented authority; BE04/bootstrap/production remain separate. |
| BE08 | IN_PROGRESS | Isolated place/map-release domain, application and PostgreSQL implementation assigned at `f440df3`; actual goal ACTIVE, source work underway. No completed behavior or runtime qualification claimed. |
| BE15 | IN_PROGRESS | [Reviewed internal receipt/outbox foundation](evidence/command-receipts-integration.md), `7cbb97e`/`c2a2c30`: 33 combined deterministic Rust, 82 Python helper and 17 real PostgreSQL tests pass; owned migration failure/recovery, restart persistence and cleanup pass. Review fixes cover keyed private fingerprints, post-authorization expiry and result/outbox revision equality. Bounded goal COMPLETE; production producer/Auth/public API/key configuration/runtime/load gates remain NOT_RUN. |
| FE05 | ACCEPTED | [Integrated evidence](evidence/ui-primitives.json) and [independent review](qa/ui-primitives-review.md): 22 DOM tests, strict build/lint, real Chrome keyboard/focus/dismissal and 44px targets at four viewports. [Style correction](evidence/ui-style-correction.json) removes prohibited left accents and offset shadows; build/lint and all four Chrome viewports pass again. Physical devices and screen readers remain separate QA work. |
| FE06 | MOCK_READY | [Theme integration review](evidence/email-and-theme-integration.md): three scoped palettes and atomic Phaser skin replacement; unchanged map/camera/movement, fallback, reentry and resource disposal pass focused262, build/lint and three-width native checks. Parent fixed-source checks pass. Production art/shell wiring, server preferences and real multiplayer remain open. |
| FE01 | ACCEPTED | [Integrated review](evidence/core-foundation-integration.md): 144 transport/error tests plus 22 existing UI tests, strict build/lint; memory-only session, bounded read refresh, cancellation, safe error/upload ports and stale-identity isolation. Real cookies and auth journeys remain BE03/FE09 work. |
| FE02 | ACCEPTED | [Integrated privacy review](evidence/privacy-local-stack-integration.md): actual QueryClient/observers, canonical private keys, cancellation plus eviction, commit fencing and cleanup ports; 45 new tests and combined 189-test transport/privacy run pass. UI/event/real-server owner wiring remains. |
| FE07 | MOCK_READY | [Integrated shell review](evidence/world-shell-integration.md), candidate `d7909c0`: 276 tests, frozen build/lint/origin scan, four installed-Chrome viewports and production-entry isolation pass. Review fixes block obsolete initial loader dispatch and bound scroll history. Actual Phaser/socket/camera preservation and device qualification remain; no real-world or IA acceptance. |
| FE08 | MOCK_READY | [Integrated public-entry review](evidence/public-entry-integration.md), `e7de0f3`: 410 parent tests, build/lint/origin/boundary, four-width Chrome/reduced-height and production isolation pass. Canonical redirect and safe synthetic document presentation delivered. Approved publication/legal/contact/retention inputs and real-service/device/IN01 gates remain open. |
| FE09 | MOCK_READY | [Real local email journey](evidence/email-and-theme-integration.md) now passes 17 actual browser checks, including transmitted revoked-cookie rejection and two-tab invalidation; integrated `2f398a3`/`bed5ffa`. Retained focused auth regressions pass. Secure/TLS, automatic restore/rotation, provider, event/world and IN01 acceptance remain open. |
| FE10 | MOCK_READY | [Real local email journey](evidence/email-and-theme-integration.md) exercises actual signup, delivered verification, wrong-code refusal and successful verification through real forms/services. Production eligibility/consent remains blocked; test enrollment policy is explicitly synthetic. Full production/device acceptance remains open. |
| FE11 | MOCK_READY | [Real local email journey](evidence/email-and-theme-integration.md) opens the actual delivered app reset link, scrubs its fragment, resets password, invalidates the peer and proves the old cookie/password rejected and new password accepted for the same identity. Secure/TLS, OAuth/device/IN01 remain NOT_RUN. |
| FE14 | MOCK_READY | [Reviewed runtime foundation](evidence/phaser-runtime-integration.md), final `77ae6bd`: 871 combined tests, strict build/lint and real Chrome four-width lifecycle/resource matrix pass. Three P2 findings corrected and independently cleared; both bounded goals COMPLETE. Production assets, protected-shell/avatar/world composition, devices and whole FE14 acceptance remain open. |
| FE15 | MOCK_READY | Reviewed movement/camera/interaction implementation `d91ee02` and bottom-edge correction `aec5d17`; independent QA `b381d03` closes visibility and valid-boundary-route findings. Worker 958 tests/22 files (87 FE15), build/lint and four-width native/short-height checks pass. Parent reran affected movement/runtime tests, build/lint and inspected mobile/short screenshots. Actual networking, authoritative physics, selected artwork, devices and full-world integration remain open. |
| FE16 | MOCK_READY | [Reviewed transport integration](evidence/world-transport-integration.md), `e3a4d84`/`5863f91`: 568 combined frontend tests (158 transport), build/lint/type-drift/origin/plan and installed-Chrome five canonical traces pass. Gap recovery and pre-send room-switch failure findings corrected. Bounded goal COMPLETE; production lifecycle, replication and real-server/IN01 remain NOT_RUN. |
| FE17 | IN_PROGRESS | Headless replication/reconnect consumer assigned at `4dc3bb3` on a fresh isolated frontend checkout with actual ACTIVE goal. Frozen C05 and existing FE16 transport; FE12 rendering/art and actual server qualification remain separate. |
| FE19 | MOCK_READY | [Places integration](evidence/places-integration.md): map overview, scoped place details and controls help; stale-target and actual reload corrections independently closed. Parent61focused/build/lint pass and all154review source hashes match. Production shell/BE08/venue/device and whole-task gates remain open. |

All unlisted task statuses remain NOT_STARTED. Accepted required tasks: **11/112**;
accepted total: **11/118**. No required IA entry or IN01–IN05 integration gate has
been accepted. Real identity/provider flows, Concert product APIs, multiplayer, transactions,
privacy/revocation, physical place verification, original production assets, real
devices, load/recovery and deployment remain outstanding. Concert foundation
startup is verified within BE05; product APIs/identity are not.

## Integration and ownership

The main checkout integrates reviewed commits serially and alone publishes master.
Five visible chats now cover real HTTP owner-chain validation, BE08 place storage,
FE17 replication implementation, independent frontend C04 consumer review and
QA C04 contract-readiness review. Each has an isolated worktree and exact writable paths. The user withdrew
the fixed-model requirement; coordination preserves chosen model/reasoning settings.
Both FE19 implementation and independent review goals completed after integration.
The extra frontend chat now implements FE17; the original prepares the exact
party/gift contract prerequisites for the next feature lane.
The original BE04 goal and all current bounded assignments are ACTIVE; prior
completed scopes remain historical. Shared Rust validation has one explicit owner.
The [chat ownership register](chat-coordination.md) records exact scopes.

Historical delivery notes below retain their original checkpoint states. Current
status is the table and ownership paragraph above.

Reviewed imports through `2b42fd4`: frontend audit/scaffold, backend audit/import,
frontend lock/toolchain configuration, exact auth review, boundary guard and C08
origin guard. The first backend import preserves source whitespace in four files;
the [recorded warnings](evidence/foundation/backend-import-whitespace.log) are not
unrelated edits. No Bigyeting UI or implementation module was imported.

Each later handoff must update this record with actual evidence and limitations;
do not advance statuses simply because a worker reports completion.

FE05 integrated as `ae24437`; its exact worker candidate is `8f9ddf7`. A separate
review reproduced and rechecked the preliminary nested-modal defect, then found
no remaining actionable issue on that candidate. Parent reran all 22 component
tests, strict build/lint and the four-viewport Chrome driver after integration.

FE11, the Auth-owned read and FE10 finished bounded review with COMPLETE goals
and stopped clean checkouts. The authenticated Auth RPC handoff and R1 correction completed parent review
with actual COMPLETE goals. Independent QA review
`e0b37cc`, integrated as `e103da2`, found no actionable defect in the event-scope
correction or Auth prerequisites; its goal is COMPLETE. The actual handler was
outside that review. The original BE04 goal remains BLOCKED. Parent owns the
shared RPC/platform prerequisite `a44f8fa`/`e79fd177` (not published as working
admission), remaining Gateway/Concert composition and the
[admission direction](identity-admission-decision.md).
The user removed any fixed backend/frontend quota; the
[capacity assessment](parallel-capacity.md) records allocation decisions.
BE03 browser/provider gates remain open.
The integrator retains shared Auth/Profile authority and C04/C06 contracts;
BE06/bootstrap follows qualified authority. No runtime, OAuth or release
acceptance follows from completed component/contract checks.


FE14 runtime/resource work has a new tool-confirmed ACTIVE goal on a fresh
frontend worktree. Auth RPC and actual-handler QA goals are now COMPLETE: R1
was a test setup race, its correction is integrated, and final clean `97a698a`
passes eleven controlled cases plus five real RPC and 22 retained PostgreSQL
cases. All source pins, restart/cleanup and independent disposition are verified.
The parent also corrected the BE15 harness's stale candidate pins after `5c02a31`;
all 98 helper tests, 138 contract regressions and planning checks pass at `d197379`.
No production moderation, identity admission or release gate is thereby enabled.


The next BE04 strict Gateway access-context increment is now tool-confirmed
ACTIVE on its fresh worktree at published `b16a679`, alongside FE14. It preserves
legacy JWT behavior and adds only a verified identity/expiry/original-stop
prerequisite; no Concert route or accepting authority is enabled by dispatch.
The completed Auth and QA checkouts remain stopped. Exact exceptions are recorded
in the ownership register. Project goal remains ACTIVE; accepted counts remain
11/112 required and 11/118 total.


Strict Gateway context worker `ed2f166`, integrated unchanged as `e7d208e`,
completed parent source/ownership review and combined 235-test, three-doctest,
library/binary qualification. Its actual bounded goal is COMPLETE and checkout
stopped; the parent owns the retained Rust target. FE14 remains ACTIVE. The idle
QA chat now has an actual ACTIVE bounded C06 format audit on a fresh report-only
checkout: it reproduced missing optional checkers and a trailing-LF plugin edge,
and reviews the parent's isolated correction. No fixed chat quota or acceptance
count changes follow from these assignments.


C06 format correction and independent report are integrated as `6a1e394`,
`04a8268` and `bab2f1f`. Parent final 144 contract regressions pass with exact
source/fixture pins; both findings are closed. QA's actual goal is COMPLETE and
checkout stopped. The backend chat now has a new actual ACTIVE owner-client goal
on fresh `be-gateway-auth-owner`, published base `e6efa4c`; its previous JWT
checkout stays stopped. FE14 handed off clean for review, retaining its ACTIVE
goal. No new chats, acceptance-count changes or production authority activation.
